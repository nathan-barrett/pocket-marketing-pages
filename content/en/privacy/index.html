              COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AS PART OF USING POCKET SERVICE
            </h5>
            <p>
              In addition to the information that you provide to us when you
              register for a user account, we collect information about the
              URLs, titles and content of the web pages and other information
              you save to Pocket. The types of information we collect includes
              your browser type, device type, time zone, language, and other
              information related to the manner in which you access the Pocket
              Technologies. If you are on a mobile device, we collect the
              advertising identifiers provided by Apple on iOS and by Google on
              Android. You can change this identifier in your device settings.
              We also collect information about your use of the Pocket
              Technologies so that we can provide our services. For example, as
              a part of providing Pocket’s syncing features, we sync information
              about the items that you save and view within Pocket so that your
              list, tags, scroll position, and other account and usage
              information may be synced across all of your devices.

            <p><strong>Types and Purposes</strong></p>
            <p>
              We use cookies and analytics tools for the following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Necessary: These cookies are necessary for our website to function 
                and to support our business. They cannot be switched off. For example, 
                we use them to manage your login state, and our ad partners use them 
                to display ads and measure impressions and clicks. You can set your 
                browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but this may cause 
                parts of the site to not work properly. These cookies do not store 
                any personally identifiable information and unless Personalized Advertising Cookies 
                are enabled, ads are non-personalized.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analytics: We place these cookies on your device to help us understand 
                how users engage with our website and product, and to remember your account 
                preferences and language settings. For example, we use Google Analytics and 
                other tools to understand which Pocket webpages are popular. We also use 
                pixels in our emails in order to collect usage information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Personalized Advertising: Some Pocket web pages have ads. If you choose, Pocket ad partners

              our website or use Pocket Technologies. You may decline our
              cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not
              be able to use certain features, you may be required to enter your
              password more frequently during a session, and you may be unable
              to install or use certain Pocket Technologies. Cookies and other
              technologies make our Pocket Technologies easier to use and help
              us customize and personalize the services we provide based on your
              interests and activities.

              collectively &quot;Pixel Tags&quot;) in connection with emails
              that we send to our users in order to collect usage data. We use
              Pixel Tags, other technologies and the information we collect to
              count users who have visited certain pages on our Website, to
              deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness
              of promotional or advertising campaigns.

            <h5 id="use">USE OF INFORMATION</h5>
            <p>
              We use your personal information to respond to your requests and
              perform our contract with you. We may do this, for example, by
              using your contact information to respond to your inquiries, to
              provide customer support and to supply any products or services
              you have requested. In addition, if you choose to use the Pocket
              Technologies to share content with another person, we will use the
              recipient&#x27;s email address or user account information to
              provide that service, but we will not use that email address for
              any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also have a legitimate business interest to operate and improve
              our services such as saving articles, videos, or other content to
              Pocket and making such content and recommendations available to
              you at a later time on any device that you use to access the
              Pocket Technologies. We also use non-identifying, aggregated
              information to analyze the manner in which the Pocket Technologies
              are used, which also allows us to improve our services. The
              aggregated information we use includes the manner in which
              articles, videos, or content has been accessed, saved and shared.
              We may use aggregated information to offer a list of top sites or
              content, to make recommendations to our users, to report on usage
              and trends, to improve the products and services that we offer, or
              to develop new products and services.
            </p>
            <h5 id="sharing">SHARING OF INFORMATION</h5>
            <p>
              Except as set forth below, we do not share any personally
              identifiable information unless you expressly agree that we may do
              so.
            </p>
            <h6>Public content</h6>
            <p>
              If you choose to make the content you save publicly available, we
              may share that information with others in accordance with the
              options you select. In addition, if you choose to use the Pocket
              Technologies to share articles, videos, or other content with
              another person, we will send an email on your behalf to that
              person with a link to the content that you have chosen to share.
            </p>
            <h6>Aggregate data</h6>
            <p>
              We also share aggregated, non-personal data and related usage
              information, which does not contain any personal information which
              can identify you or any other individual user, with third parties,
              including content providers, website operators, advertisers and
              publishers. For example, we may share with a content provider a
              list of the most saved articles to Pocket based on an analysis of
              aggregated, anonymous user data, but we would not share with such
              content provider any personal information regarding such users.
            </p>
            <h6>Links to other sites and apps</h6>
            <p>
              If you choose to, you may connect your Pocket account to
              third-party applications to enable additional features like saving
              from your favorite apps or other unique features third-party
              developers have created. We have set up controls in the Pocket
              application so that you can control the information that is shared
              with third-party providers of products and services. For example,
              you may be informed that another app that you use wants to connect
              to your Pocket account. In some cases, such apps will request
              access to certain data in your Pocket account, such as your Pocket
              list or your preferred topics, sites and authors (which we have
              developed based on the content you have saved to Pocket), so that
              they can customize their services. Before such access is provided,
              however, you will be asked to authorize the sharing of any such
              information. Although the Pocket Technologies may be used in
              conjunction with third-party products and services, we are not
              affiliated with, and have no control over, such third parties.
              Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy,
              this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information
              we collect from you and we encourage you to check the privacy
              policy of each third-party provider of products or services that
              you choose to connect your Pocket account to.
            </p>
            <h6>Working with third parties</h6>
            <p>
              We may work with trusted third parties to facilitate one or more
              aspects of the products,services, or features that we provide to
              you, and we may provide some of your personal information directly
              to these third parties. For example, as discussed above, we may
              use a third party payment processor to process payments for our
              paid subscription service. We may also share limited aggregated
              data with our advertising partners (read more in the “Aggregate
              data” section above). These parties are subject to confidentiality
              agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit
              their use of the information we provide to them for any other
              purpose other than those discussed above, unless you have
              explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for
              additional uses. If you use the &quot;Listen&quot; feature, we may
              share the content of the article with a third party service in
              order to read the article aloud.
            </p>
            <h6>Sharing as required by law or asset sale</h6>
            <p>
              In the event that we or certain of our assets are acquired, user
              information may be included among the transferred assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we strive to protect the personal information of our
              users, we will release personal information if required by law or
              in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary. We follow
              the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government
              or related to a lawsuit. We will notify you when we are asked to
              hand over your personally identifiable information in this way
              unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive
              requests like this, we will only release your personally
              identifiable information if we have a good faith belief that
              disclosure is necessary or appropriate under applicable law.
              Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or
              objections that you may have to a third party&#x27;s request to
              disclose your information.
            </p>
            <h5 id="keeping">KEEPING INFORMATION</h5>
            <p>
              We will keep your information only for as long as we need it to
              provide you services, manage our business or as required by law or
              contract.
            </p>
            <h5 id="transfer">TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</h5>
            <p>
              We&#x27;re a global organization and our computers are in several
              different places around the world. We also use service providers
              whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that
              your information might end up on one of those computers in another
              country, and that country may have a different level of data
              protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you
              consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter
              what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law
              and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy
              policy.
            </p>
            <h5 id="security">SECURITY</h5>
            <p>
              We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other
              security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse
              and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our
              control or under the control of our service providers. Your
              personally identifiable information is protected by utilizing both
              online and offline security methods, including firewalls,
              passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your
              information is stored. Although we use industry standard practices
              to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not
              expect, that your personal information or private communications
              will always remain free from security issues. In the event of a
              security breach involving your personal information, we will make
              any legally required disclosures to you in the most expedient time
              possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the
              legitimate interests of law enforcement, or any measures necessary
              to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
              integrity of the data system.
            </p>
            <h5 id="phishing">PHISHING</h5>
            <p>
              Identity theft and the practice currently known as
              &quot;phishing&quot; are of great concern to Pocket. Safeguarding
              information to help protect you from identity theft is a top
              priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your
              username, password, credit card information or national
              identification number in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone
              communication. For more information about phishing, visit the
              Federal Trade Commission’s website.

            <h5 id="opt-out">MANAGING MY PRIVACY AND EMAIL SETTINGS</h5>
            <p>
              You can access, correct, or delete your personal information and
              export your data from your Pocket Profile. You can also view and
              control which third party services, if any, you want to connect to

              As part of our default settings to share saved and recommended

              your account settings. We will try to communicate with you only

              process your request.

              Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We

              to our Privacy Policy that affect user information already stored
              in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website
              notifying users that our Privacy Policy has changed. Our use of
